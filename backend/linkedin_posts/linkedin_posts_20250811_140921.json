Sustainability can mean starting from scratch—but more often, it’s about analyzing and reimagining what we already have.\n\nTake for example, our MRI systems where an upgraded cold head can mean using far less helium or a refurbished scanner can be carefully restored to serve patients for years to come. Another example is our lab diagnostic systems. These workhorses often run nonstop in busy hospital labs and, after years of heavy use, can be rigorously restored with the latest hardware and software to perform like new.\n\nThese quieter forms of innovation are powerful. Not only do they extend the life of critical technology, they also reduce waste and preserve precious resources. It’s progress—not by replacement, but by renewal.\n\nEqually inspiring is the craftsmanship behind it: Engineers who design smarter ways to trap and reuse helium. Teams who recalibrate systems with precision and care. Their work isn’t always seen, but the impact is felt in every scan delivered without delay and in every patient diagnosis made possible.\n\nAt, we believe sustainability starts with design, but lives in the details. That sometimes, a system’s “end of life” is really just the start of a better one.",

      "content": "Siemens Healthineers has made a strong start to the second half of the year. We had a very good quarter with high revenue growth, another increase in profitability, and strong free cash flow. Our revenue rose by 7.6% on a comparable basis to just under €5.7 billion. The Imaging andsegments, in particular, contributed to this very strong revenue development. Equipment order intake clearly exceeded equipment revenue. The equipment book-to-bill ratio was good, at 1.09.\n\nWhile volatility in the geopolitical environment remains high, our performance shows the value of our healthcare innovations for more and more patients around the world. As a result of the latest geopolitical developments, in particular the agreements on trade tariffs, we narrow the ranges for comparable revenue growth and adjusted basic earnings per share in our outlook for fiscal year 2025. We also raise the midpoints of the ranges, mainly due to our performance year to date.\n\nWe win as\ntogether with our customers and partners. Jointly – and often over years and decades – we fight serious illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and dementia. Over the past few weeks, I have had the opportunity to meet some of our partners to mark some special occasions. We strengthened our relationships further and are making good progress in the task of taking the fear out of the most threatening diseases: Firstly, by working tirelessly on new technologies and improving existing solutions. Secondly, by making these technologies and solutions accessible to more and more people.\n\nBecause this is our purpose: pioneering breakthroughs in healthcare – for everyone, everywhere, sustainably.

Often, it’s about making what we already see more precise—and more accessible to those who need it most.\n\nTake Cinematic Reality, portrayed in one of the background images on my profile. It marks a shift from flat, grayscale slices to vivid 3D visualizations where anatomy takes on depth, texture, and life-like detail. These immersive, interactive holograms are created directly from real patient data and allow clinicians to explore the human body in entirely new ways.\n\nThey can rotate a heart in virtual space, trace the nervous system, or examine a tumor from every angle. It’s not just visually stunning; it’s clinically valuable and offers a lot of potential: Surgeons can plan more precisely. Students can learn more intuitively. Patients can receive care that’s more personalized, more informed.

      "content": "What an honor to be in Cleveland, Ohio, celebrating 40 years of partnership with Case Western Reserve University, a collaboration that began just two years after MRI technology became available. \n\nIt’s great reconnecting with renowned experts and colleagues to reflect on how far we’ve come since installing our first clinical system there. When we first started working together, many of the applications we rely on today were still on the horizon. Scans were slow, the experience for patients was often uncomfortable, and image quality was a far cry from what we expect now.\n\nTogether, we were motivated by the possibilities to shape this field and so, we started pushing boundaries early on. For example, our work on real-time MRI in the 80s helped lay the groundwork for what we now know as minimally invasive, image-guided procedures. These helped make interventions safer and patient recovery times shorter. Then, thanks to various breakthroughs in the following decades, 3D imaging became reality, scans got faster and more precise, and images became clearer and more detailed.\n\nBecause of contributions from partnerships like ours, MRI turned into what we know today: a quicker, more comfortable experience for patients, and a powerful and versatile tool for providers to screen, diagnose, and treat with confidence. It’s been an exciting journey of transforming 𝐛𝐨𝐥𝐝 ideas into solutions used around the world. In many ways, we’re just getting started. We’re already exploring what’s next in precision imaging, AI-driven workflows, and scaling innovations across entire fleets of scanners.\n\nA heartfelt congratulations to the team of experts at Case Western andwho have made these 40 years so meaningful. Your camaraderie, curiosity, and brilliance are behind every breakthrough and the reasons this partnership continues to move forward and deliver real impact for patients and communities.\n\nThank you,,,,,,,,,,,... your teams, and so many more!",

Sometimes it’s a small vial—filled with a few teaspoons of blood—that carries the potential to change a life.\n\nTake multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that affects nearly 3 million people worldwide. For many, the wait for symptoms to appear, or for imaging to confirm what they already feel, can be full of uncertainty. Now a simple blood test can deliver key insights and help ensure patients get the right care at the right time. I find this quiet breakthrough so powerful.\n\nThe test targets neurofilament light chain (NfL), a blood-based biomarker now detectable with a diagnostic test. This is the first CE-marked* biomarker for MS. When used together with other clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, NfL can help predict the risk of MS disease activity in an individual patient with RMS. These earlier insights help clinicians personalize treatment earlier and give the patient something often missing: clarity.\n\nIt’s not dramatic on the outside, but the impact is very real.

It’s not always the news of the moment, but it’s the foundation of who we are and what I find fascinating and worth sharing. I’m always astonished by how far we’ve come as a team, and excited by the pace at which we’re changing what will be possible tomorrow. So why not shine a light on some of the overlooked details—or, better yet, the quiet breakthroughs that make all the difference?\n\nEach background picture on my profile has its own story to tell. Yes, as a physicist and a Healthineer, I may be a bit biased. But I think many would agree: there’s a lot of art in science. And the details are often extraordinary.\n\nTake photon-counting CT, for example. To pioneer breakthroughs like this, we now grow crystals—cadmium telluride, to be exact—over 12 intense weeks. In nature, the same process would take millions of years. The purest cadmium telluride crystal is the starting point for a quantum leap in computed tomography technology. Years of research, development, and production have led to the creation of pure crystals with electrical properties that have revolutionized CT detector technology.\n\nYes, it’s technical. But the impact is very human.\n\nEvery touchpoint matters. Because these carefully grown crystals help deliver sharper insights, earlier answers, and better outcomes for everyone, everywhere, sustainably.\n\nThis is just one glimpse behind the curtain. What do you think about this one? I’ll be sharing what catches my attention from each background soon!",

For me personally, it has been an absolute privilege to experience more than half of that journey so far, seeing how our progress and pioneering role in CT exemplify what our company stands for.\n\nI joined the CT team as a product manager 26 years ago, right after we launched our newest innovation at the time: multislice CT technology with the SOMATOM Volume Zoom. Multislice took CT to another level, starting to transform the cross-sectional imaging (essentially, a 2D paradigm) into producing an \"isotropic 3D copy\" of the patient. A universe of new clinical applications opened up: from metastasis screening to vascular imaging to the first CT images of the coronaries. And viewing slices like on a film sheet, turned into browsing in the \"3D copy\" of the patient with the first post-processing applications.\n\nMaking these breakthroughs available for everyone everywhere quickly became our target and within just one decade, all of our CT scanners, even in the entry level, had multislice technology inside.\n\nAmong the things our CT team is exemplary for all Healthineers: the team constantly thinks ahead, never resting on their laurels. Even amid the \"Slice Wars\" in the early 2000s, they were already at work on the revolutionary dual-source CT technology while simultaneously starting the photon-counting project and becoming the frontrunner in AI applications. Their enduring mindset has driven incredible advances in cardiovascular imaging and in diagnosing cancer, stroke, and lung disease. CT has become so widely used across many cases that it’s now an essential tool in clinical settings like the emergency room and radiotherapy planning – the latter being elementary in our successful combination with.\n\nAs for photon-counting CT… We – and more importantly, many of our customers – are convinced it’s set to become the standard for CT in the future. It has the potential to be a true catalyst in preventive healthcare, helping to detect diseases earlier and creating an almost digital twin of the patient. With that level of insight, clinicians can make faster and more personalized decisions on the next step for their patient.\n\nWe were the first to introduce the photon-counting CT scanner in 2021. Our focus has since shifted to a bigger question: how can we ensure everyone, everywhere truly benefits from this technology? Just as we were the fastest to make multislice CT accessible to all, our ambition now is to positively impact 1 billion lives over the next decade by bringing photon-counting CT within reach of more communities.\n\nWe got to this point because of the dedication, vision, and hard work of\nand – as importantly – through the inspiration, collaboration, trust, and scientific brilliance of our partners in clinical research in medical institutions worldwide. Thank you!",

Viele von ihnen stehen am Anfang ihrer Karriere und wollen wissen, wie das bei mir damals war. Besonders häufig kommen diese drei Fragen. Vielleicht hilft es ja jemandem, wenn ich sie hier einmal gesammelt beantworte – ohne Anspruch auf Allgemeingültigkeit.\n\n🚀 \"Wie war der Start in dein Berufsleben?\"\n\nIch habe nach meiner Promotion in Theoretischer Physik bei Siemens angefangen. Aber es hat etwas gedauert, bis ich dort den richtigen Platz für mich gefunden hatte. Doch mit dem Verständnis für die Zusammenhänge von Medizin, Technik, Wirtschaft und Gesundheit wuchs dann auch die Begeisterung immer mehr. Ich weiß noch sehr genau, wie ich plötzlich morgens ohne Wecker aufgewacht bin, weil ich unbedingt wieder loslegen wollte, weil mich meine Aufgabe und die Menschen dort so fasziniert haben.\n\n🧠 \"Wer war – oder ist – dein Vorbild?\"\n\nIch glaube, dass man von jedem Menschen etwas lernen kann. Das ist das Schöne an diversen, internationalen Teams, wo jedes Mitglied einen anderen Hintergrund und andere Erfahrungen mitbringt. Besonders gerne erinnere ich mich aber an Professor Erich Reinhardt, damals Bereichsvorstand für die Medizintechnik bei Siemens. Er hat uns beigebracht, wie man richtig streitet. Das beste Argument zählt, nicht wer es vorbringt. \"Wir brauchen eine Streitkultur, keinen Harmonieterror\", hat er oft gesagt. Und damit hat er das Unternehmen, das ich jetzt führen darf, bis heute geprägt.\n\n🍽️ \"Hast du ein Rezept für beruflichen Erfolg?\"\n\nIch habe kein Rezept, aber vielleicht einen Rat. In der Rückschau sehe ich meinen Weg als eine Verkettung glücklicher Zufälle. Aber diese Zufälle müssen schon auf eine gute Vorbereitung treffen, damit sie auch wirken können. Ich glaube, für junge Menschen ist es wichtig, sich verschiedene Dinge anschauen zu können. So findet man heraus, was einen wirklich begeistert. Das Leben ist zu kurz, um Dinge zu tun, die man nicht liebt. Und dann wird man auch nicht gut darin. Lasst euch also nicht von anderen stressen, wenn ihr mit 18 oder 20 noch keinen großen Plan habt. Aber wartet auch nicht, bis euch auf magische Weise die Motivation überkommt. Fangt etwas an, schnuppert rein – wenn es das Richtige für euch ist, folgen Motivation und Erfolg dann ganz automatisch.\n\nVor einiger Zeit hatfür diemit mir dazu gesprochen. Hier ein paar O-Töne aus unserem Gespräch; der Link zum kompletten Interview (dort mit englischen Untertiteln) steht unten in den Kommentaren.",

At the same time, we would like to remember the hope that the end of the war brought to Europe and the world. International cohesion, the rule of law, and freedom are achievements that we must protect together.\n\nOur democracy is precious, it thrives on participation, courage and dissent. It also requires effort and many compromises, but in return it gives us peace, security and prosperity – and provides us with the strength to stand up for others who are threatened by war, terror, and persecution today.

      "content": "With Easter and perhaps a spring vacation just around the corner, you may be looking for some food for thought. I'd like to recommend three eye-opening \nhashtag\n#books that explore human nature with a sense of \nhashtag\n#hope – both through\nand personal narrative.\n\n📖 \"The Righteous Mind\" (2012) by Jonathan Haidt:\n\nI greatly admire's work and recently had the privilege of meeting him at the WEF 2025. Jonathan is a social psychologist at the. \"The Righteous Mind\" is not his most recent book, but a bestseller that offers explanations for many questions driving society and politics today. How does social polarization develop? Why do we have such different moral perceptions of justice, freedom, and authority? Why are we individuals on the one hand and enjoy being part of groups on the other? And what is this built-in \"PR agency\" that justifies our actions to others?\n\n📖 \"Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society\" (2019) by Nicholas A. Christakis:\n\nAnother bestseller, another deep dive into our DNA, minds and societies:is a social scientist and physician atwhose work focuses on network science and biosocial science. His book \"Blueprint\" really resonated with me, in showing that our ability to build fair, cooperative communities is hardwired into our DNA—it's human nature, not just ideology. It helped me see why many utopian visions fail: they overlook the social structures we're biologically built to form. The book highlights the common ground we all share. In times of division, I found \"Blueprint\" to be a refreshing take on the idea that the drive to build inclusive, connected communities isn’t political—it's human.\n\n📖 \"Vaterländer\" (2024) by Sabin Tambrea:\n\nSabin Tambrea is a German actor with Romanian roots. His German novel \"Vaterländer\" draws from real events and his family’s personal experiences. It's an incredibly sensitive and moving book, in which the author tells how the communist dictatorship in Romania under Nicolae Ceaușescu oppressed three generations of his family and caused them immense suffering—leading to their escape and a fresh start in Germany. It made me reflect on utopias, on why dictatorships can persist for so long—and it offers a lot of hope through its humanity.",

It’s a notion that’s flourishing in Türkiye, where our \nhashtag\n#TeamHealthineers, along with collaborative partners, are advancing healthcare innovation both for their country and the world. \n\nThe very recent opening of Innovation Center Istanbul marks a bold step towards this progress. As part of theglobal innovation network, this fourth location will work in synergy with our existing centers in Germany, China, and India. By connecting with other innovators and experts, we aim to drive solutions that address both global and local healthcare challenges. To that end, we have invited start-ups, academic institutions, and clinical partners to collaborate with us on initiatives that align with our goals or have a meaningful local impact. In return, we provide them a platform backed by our expertise and global reach, helping to scale healthcare solutions, particularly in digital health, AI, and precision and personalized healthcare technologies.\n\nIt was a pleasure to join our Turkish team in celebrating this milestone, seeing firsthand how innovation happens wherever people with different expertise enter the dialogue. Innovation Center Istanbul was also received with great interest by our Turkish customers and partners, whom I was honored to meet on this trip. Together, we are fighting non-communicable diseases in Türkiye and around the world. I’m excited about the new ideas that will emerge from Istanbul, helping us to continue our successful journey in pioneering breakthroughs in healthcare – for everyone, everywhere, sustainably.\n\nCongratulations to,,, and the entire Turkish team for bringing this Center to life!

(BBUG), preparing for increasingly responsible roles alongside amazing peers from companies across various industries. Today, after more than 10 years as CEO of, I had the honor and pleasure of speaking to those who are now preparing for their own future leadership roles, having been nominated by their companies.\n\nI always greatly enjoy moments like these—they are enriching, offering fresh perspectives and thought-provoking questions. Plus, simply explaining one’s own work helps sharpen one’s own thinking.\n\nOf course, there was a lot to share at the beginning: about non-communicable diseases (cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, etc.), which we are dedicated to combating; about access to care for 8 billion people; and about the shortage of healthcare professionals among our customers. We also discussed our IPO, the combination with, the central role of AI in our products, the path to groundbreaking innovations like Photon-Counting CT, and our Value Partnerships with leading customers.\n\nThe discussion that followed was lively and engaging, conducted under Chatham House Rules—which is why I summarize the following seven key takeaways:\n\n1️⃣ We should not see healthcare spending as a cost but as an investment in a better life.\n2️⃣ The healthcare industry is a vital yet often underestimated part of a country's economic value creation.\n3️⃣ Medical technology is an exciting \"dialogue discipline\" where progress is only possible through deep mutual understanding between medical professionals and engineers. This is fascinating—but also teaches humility.\n4️⃣ Our IPO allowed us to create a much more focused company, entirely dedicated to our specific customer base, and to reinvent ourselves. I am deeply grateful for that. And only through the IPO the combination with Varian was possible, for example.\n5️⃣ Progress always moves in two directions: Improving what already exists and creating access where it was previously unaffordable.For example, digitalization initially digitizes what was analog, but \"digital first\" solutions bypass analog altogether, making things possible for the first time. Many medical breakthroughs follow the same principle.\n6️⃣ Right now, we talk a lot about managing change in the world. My advice: from time to time, consciously reflect on what does NOT change and what always holds true.\n7️⃣ And lastly: Take good care of your own health and your relationships.\n\nThank you,, for the invitation, and thank you to all the participants for the fantastic discussion!",

This stems from our fundamental belief that healthcare innovation must reach everyone, everywhere.\n\nAs a global medtech leader, we have both the capability and responsibility to improve children’s lives worldwide. No single organization can do that alone: UNICEF's unparalleled reach and decades of experience in delivering healthcare solutions to underserved communities, combined with our technological expertise creates a powerful synergy that can drive meaningful change. Our experience with UNICEF has shown that partnerships between private sector companies and international organizations can bridge critical gaps in healthcare delivery.\n\nToday we met in Berlin at Schloss Bellevue, the residence of the German Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and First Lady Elke Buedenbender, patron of. The motto of the UNICEF New Year's Talk 2025 was “The future is unwritten”. We discussed how we can support the rights of the generations to come so that young people have the opportunity and skills to help shape society from an early age.\n\nMany thanks to Elke Buedenbender, Alisha Kumar, Yolanda Tembo,, Burkhard Jung,,, Georg Graf Waldersee and.",
