Sustainability can mean starting from scratch—but more often, it’s about analyzing and reimagining what we already have.\n\nTake for example, our MRI systems where an upgraded cold head can mean using far less helium or a refurbished scanner can be carefully restored to serve patients for years to come. Another example is our lab diagnostic systems. These workhorses often run nonstop in busy hospital labs and, after years of heavy use, can be rigorously restored with the latest hardware and software to perform like new.\n\nThese quieter forms of innovation are powerful. Not only do they extend the life of critical technology, they also reduce waste and preserve precious resources. It’s progress—not by replacement, but by renewal.\n\nEqually inspiring is the craftsmanship behind it: Engineers who design smarter ways to trap and reuse helium. Teams who recalibrate systems with precision and care. Their work isn’t always seen, but the impact is felt in every scan delivered without delay and in every patient diagnosis made possible.\n\nAt, we believe sustainability starts with design, but lives in the details. That sometimes, a system’s “end of life” is really just the start of a better one.",

      "content": "Siemens Healthineers has made a strong start to the second half of the year. We had a very good quarter with high revenue growth, another increase in profitability, and strong free cash flow. Our revenue rose by 7.6% on a comparable basis to just under €5.7 billion. The Imaging andsegments, in particular, contributed to this very strong revenue development. Equipment order intake clearly exceeded equipment revenue. The equipment book-to-bill ratio was good, at 1.09.\n\nWhile volatility in the geopolitical environment remains high, our performance shows the value of our healthcare innovations for more and more patients around the world. As a result of the latest geopolitical developments, in particular the agreements on trade tariffs, we narrow the ranges for comparable revenue growth and adjusted basic earnings per share in our outlook for fiscal year 2025. We also raise the midpoints of the ranges, mainly due to our performance year to date.\n\nWe win as\ntogether with our customers and partners. Jointly – and often over years and decades – we fight serious illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and dementia. Over the past few weeks, I have had the opportunity to meet some of our partners to mark some special occasions. We strengthened our relationships further and are making good progress in the task of taking the fear out of the most threatening diseases: Firstly, by working tirelessly on new technologies and improving existing solutions. Secondly, by making these technologies and solutions accessible to more and more people.\n\nBecause this is our purpose: pioneering breakthroughs in healthcare – for everyone, everywhere, sustainably. Thank you,\n, for bringing it to life every day!",

Often, it’s about making what we already see more precise—and more accessible to those who need it most.\n\nTake Cinematic Reality, portrayed in one of the background images on my profile. It marks a shift from flat, grayscale slices to vivid 3D visualizations where anatomy takes on depth, texture, and life-like detail. These immersive, interactive holograms are created directly from real patient data and allow clinicians to explore the human body in entirely new ways.\n\nThey can rotate a heart in virtual space, trace the nervous system, or examine a tumor from every angle. It’s not just visually stunning; it’s clinically valuable and offers a lot of potential: Surgeons can plan more precisely. Students can learn more intuitively. Patients can receive care that’s more personalized, more informed. I find this so inspiring because when we see with greater clarity, we can care with greater confidence.\n\nSometimes the most beautiful breakthroughs aren’t just what we see, but how we see.",

      "content": "What an honor to be in Cleveland, Ohio, celebrating 40 years of partnership with Case Western Reserve University, a collaboration that began just two years after MRI technology became available. \n\nIt’s great reconnecting with renowned experts and colleagues to reflect on how far we’ve come since installing our first clinical system there. When we first started working together, many of the applications we rely on today were still on the horizon. Scans were slow, the experience for patients was often uncomfortable, and image quality was a far cry from what we expect now.\n\nTogether, we were motivated by the possibilities to shape this field and so, we started pushing boundaries early on. For example, our work on real-time MRI in the 80s helped lay the groundwork for what we now know as minimally invasive, image-guided procedures. These helped make interventions safer and patient recovery times shorter. Then, thanks to various breakthroughs in the following decades, 3D imaging became reality, scans got faster and more precise, and images became clearer and more detailed.\n\nBecause of contributions from partnerships like ours, MRI turned into what we know today: a quicker, more comfortable experience for patients, and a powerful and versatile tool for providers to screen, diagnose, and treat with confidence. It’s been an exciting journey of transforming 𝐛𝐨𝐥𝐝 ideas into solutions used around the world. In many ways, we’re just getting started. We’re already exploring what’s next in precision imaging, AI-driven workflows, and scaling innovations across entire fleets of scanners.\n\nA heartfelt congratulations to the team of experts at Case Western andwho have made these 40 years so meaningful. Your camaraderie, curiosity, and brilliance are behind every breakthrough and the reasons this partnership continues to move forward and deliver real impact for patients and communities.\n\nThank you,,,,,,,,,,,... your teams, and so many more!",

      "content": "Not all our breakthroughs in medical technology look like a big machine. Sometimes it’s a small vial—filled with a few teaspoons of blood—that carries the potential to change a life.\n\nTake multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that affects nearly 3 million people worldwide. For many, the wait for symptoms to appear, or for imaging to confirm what they already feel, can be full of uncertainty. Now a simple blood test can deliver key insights and help ensure patients get the right care at the right time. I find this quiet breakthrough so powerful.\n\nThe test targets neurofilament light chain (NfL), a blood-based biomarker now detectable with a diagnostic test. This is the first CE-marked* biomarker for MS. When used together with other clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, NfL can help predict the risk of MS disease activity in an individual patient with RMS. These earlier insights help clinicians personalize treatment earlier and give the patient something often missing: clarity.\n\nIt’s not dramatic on the outside, but the impact is very real. This is the kind of innovation I believe deserves more attention—the kind that puts meaningful change in a small vial.\n\n*𝘊𝘌-0197. 𝘕𝘰𝘵 𝘢𝘷𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘜.𝘚. 𝘈𝘷𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘢𝘣𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘺 𝘷𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘣𝘺 𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵𝘳𝘺.",

It’s not always the news of the moment, but it’s the foundation of who we are and what I find fascinating and worth sharing. I’m always astonished by how far we’ve come as a team, and excited by the pace at which we’re changing what will be possible tomorrow. So why not shine a light on some of the overlooked details—or, better yet, the quiet breakthroughs that make all the difference?\n\nEach background picture on my profile has its own story to tell. Yes, as a physicist and a Healthineer, I may be a bit biased. But I think many would agree: there’s a lot of art in science. And the details are often extraordinary.\n\nTake photon-counting CT, for example. To pioneer breakthroughs like this, we now grow crystals—cadmium telluride, to be exact—over 12 intense weeks. In nature, the same process would take millions of years. The purest cadmium telluride crystal is the starting point for a quantum leap in computed tomography technology. Years of research, development, and production have led to the creation of pure crystals with electrical properties that have revolutionized CT detector technology.\n\nYes, it’s technical. But the impact is very human.\n\nEvery touchpoint matters. Because these carefully grown crystals help deliver sharper insights, earlier answers, and better outcomes for everyone, everywhere, sustainably.\n\nThis is just one glimpse behind the curtain. What do you think about this one? I’ll be sharing what catches my attention from each background soon!",

For me personally, it has been an absolute privilege to experience more than half of that journey so far, seeing how our progress and pioneering role in CT exemplify what our company stands for.\n\nI joined the CT team as a product manager 26 years ago, right after we launched our newest innovation at the time: multislice CT technology with the SOMATOM Volume Zoom. Multislice took CT to another level, starting to transform the cross-sectional imaging (essentially, a 2D paradigm) into producing an \"isotropic 3D copy\" of the patient. A universe of new clinical applications opened up: from metastasis screening to vascular imaging to the first CT images of the coronaries. And viewing slices like on a film sheet, turned into browsing in the \"3D copy\" of the patient with the first post-processing applications.\n\nMaking these breakthroughs available for everyone everywhere quickly became our target and within just one decade, all of our CT scanners, even in the entry level, had multislice technology inside.\n\nAmong the things our CT team is exemplary for all Healthineers: the team constantly thinks ahead, never resting on their laurels. Even amid the \"Slice Wars\" in the early 2000s, they were already at work on the revolutionary dual-source CT technology while simultaneously starting the photon-counting project and becoming the frontrunner in AI applications. Their enduring mindset has driven incredible advances in cardiovascular imaging and in diagnosing cancer, stroke, and lung disease. CT has become so widely used across many cases that it’s now an essential tool in clinical settings like the emergency room and radiotherapy planning – the latter being elementary in our successful combination with.\n\nAs for photon-counting CT… We – and more importantly, many of our customers – are convinced it’s set to become the standard for CT in the future. It has the potential to be a true catalyst in preventive healthcare, helping to detect diseases earlier and creating an almost digital twin of the patient. With that level of insight, clinicians can make faster and more personalized decisions on the next step for their patient.\n\nWe were the first to introduce the photon-counting CT scanner in 2021. Our focus has since shifted to a bigger question: how can we ensure everyone, everywhere truly benefits from this technology? Just as we were the fastest to make multislice CT accessible to all, our ambition now is to positively impact 1 billion lives over the next decade by bringing photon-counting CT within reach of more communities.\n\nWe got to this point because of the dedication, vision, and hard work of\nand – as importantly – through the inspiration, collaboration, trust, and scientific brilliance of our partners in clinical research in medical institutions worldwide. Thank you!",
