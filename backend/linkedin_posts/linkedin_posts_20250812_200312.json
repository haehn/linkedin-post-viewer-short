They began and ended with reflexive learning, anchoring their work in shared understanding. They placed exploratory learning (experimental and contextual) in the middle. This rhythm—reflection → exploration → reflection—helped them reduce friction, integrate insights, and build real momentum.\n\nWe also found that vicarious learning can be combined with reflexive learning in the same project phase with positive results. But when teams mixed reflexive with experimental or contextual learning in the same phase, performance suffered.\n\n𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆: Innovation doesn’t thrive on more learning. It thrives on structured learning. Teams that sequence and separate their learning activities make faster, clearer progress.\n\nWe’ve summarized the findings from our research, published in—a leading journal in organizational research—in this newarticle.

The responses were fascinating—and telling.\n\nMany chose c.\n\nAnd that’s completely understandable. As leaders, we’re often under pressure to have the answers, to deliver results, and to ‘get it right’. But here’s the thing:\n⚠️ If failure isn’t an option, neither is learning. ⚠️\n\nWhat we explored together in that session was this:\nIf we want growth and better leadership—we need an appetite for failure. Not recklessness, but a genuine willingness to experiment, get things wrong, and learn fast. I'm talking aboutand her idea of intelligent failure.\n\nThe leaders who grow the most are the ones who can say:\n\"I didn’t get that right—and here’s what I learned.\"\n\nThey're also the leaders who enable the development of others because they create a safe space where others can also try things out, take measured risks, learn and grow without fear of judgement or retribution.\n\nSo, how do YOU feel about failure? And more importantly—what are you doing to build a culture where it’s not just tolerated, but seen as essential for progress?\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts 👇 type your answer to my question above - a,b,c or d in the comments below.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBeing a manager or a founder shouldn’t be 💩\n\nI work with managers, leaders, founders and their businesses using coaching and training to ensure that it isn’t.\n\nI ensure that individuals have the knowledge and awareness to embrace their roles with energy and enjoyment, connect with their confidence and capabilities, and take control of their development and growth, to ensure that they thrive for themselves, their teams, and their businesses.\n\nBecause when we enjoy what we do, we do a great job.

The final line hit me: this wasn’t just an engineering failure—it was a culture failure.\n\nStockton Rush, OceanGate’s founder and CEO, had a bold vision: to democratize deep-sea exploration. But that vision became untouchable. Criticizing the approach became synonymous with criticizing him personally.\n\nFormer chief pilotLochbridge was fired after raising safety concerns, and over time, anyone who challenged the direction either left or was pushed out.\nOceanGate bypassed third-party safety certification from agencies like DNV, arguing it stifled innovation. They used experimental carbon fiber materials against industry norms and ignored repeated warnings about hull fatigue and structural integrity.\n\nThe result? A catastrophic implosion on June 18, 2023, killing all five people onboard, including Rush himself.\n\nThis story echoes whathas long researched around psychological safety—where team members feel safe to speak up, especially about risk. She’s pointed to NASA’s Columbia disaster, where engineers suspected damage to the shuttle but stayed silent during final briefings. The culture didn’t support dissent. The hierarchy silenced truth.\nHere’s what we can learn as leaders:\n\n- Detach your ego from the mission. You are not your product.\n- Normalize dissent. Especially from the smartest, most principled voices.\n- Invite challenge early and often. Don’t wait for a wake-up call.\n- Set red lines for safety, ethics, and integrity. They are non-negotiable.\n\nTo do great things, yes, we need vision. But we also need humility. Especially when human lives—or entire organizations—are on the line.",

It's a wonderful addition to any summer learning lineup!\n\nAnd for any HR and L&D leaders who follow me, you can explore the entire LIT library with two weeks of complimentary access to LIT for Teams. I've been told to mention \"Fearless\" when you fill out the form😉👉",

A hole in your block of cheese can be seen as a flaw, but these holes are discrete and contained, leaving the cheese intact.\n\nBut sometimes the Swiss cheese holes line up, despite being separated by time or distance, to create a tunnel through which complex failure flows unimpeded.\n\nThis visual model helps emphasize the importance of adding layers of defense to combat system failures.\n\nLearning from past failures, welcoming false alarms, and building a culture of\nall increase the likelihood that teams will catch and correct these small errors before something catastrophic occurs.\n\nWe can't erase human error, but we can aim for zero harm.\n\nMore on\nin my book\n:",
