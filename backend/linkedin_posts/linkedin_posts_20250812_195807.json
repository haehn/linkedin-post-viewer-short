They began and ended with reflexive learning, anchoring their work in shared understanding. They placed exploratory learning (experimental and contextual) in the middle. This rhythm—reflection → exploration → reflection—helped them reduce friction, integrate insights, and build real momentum.\n\nWe also found that vicarious learning can be combined with reflexive learning in the same project phase with positive results. But when teams mixed reflexive with experimental or contextual learning in the same phase, performance suffered.\n\n𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆: Innovation doesn’t thrive on more learning. It thrives on structured learning. Teams that sequence and separate their learning activities make faster, clearer progress.\n\nWe’ve summarized the findings from our research, published in—a leading journal in organizational research—in this newarticle.

The responses were fascinating—and telling.\n\nMany chose c.\n\nAnd that’s completely understandable. As leaders, we’re often under pressure to have the answers, to deliver results, and to ‘get it right’. But here’s the thing:\n⚠️ If failure isn’t an option, neither is learning. ⚠️\n\nWhat we explored together in that session was this:\nIf we want growth and better leadership—we need an appetite for failure. Not recklessness, but a genuine willingness to experiment, get things wrong, and learn fast. I'm talking aboutand her idea of intelligent failure.\n\nThe leaders who grow the most are the ones who can say:\n\"I didn’t get that right—and here’s what I learned.\"\n\nThey're also the leaders who enable the development of others because they create a safe space where others can also try things out, take measured risks, learn and grow without fear of judgement or retribution.\n\nSo, how do YOU feel about failure? And more importantly—what are you doing to build a culture where it’s not just tolerated, but seen as essential for progress?\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts 👇 type your answer to my question above - a,b,c or d in the comments below.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBeing a manager or a founder shouldn’t be 💩\n\nI work with managers, leaders, founders and their businesses using coaching and training to ensure that it isn’t.\n\nI ensure that individuals have the knowledge and awareness to embrace their roles with energy and enjoyment, connect with their confidence and capabilities, and take control of their development and growth, to ensure that they thrive for themselves, their teams, and their businesses.\n\nBecause when we enjoy what we do, we do a great job.

I’m an accountant.”\nThat’s what one employee thought when she was handed the game controller to pilot a deep-sea sub.\n\nI just watched Titan: The OceanGate Disaster, a story that goes far beyond technology or engineering.\n\nFive lives lost. A vision so bold it became untouchable.\nA culture that dismissed concerns and punished dissent.\n\nHow do you fire your chief pilot for raising safety concerns?\nWhy reject third-party safety reviews in the name of “innovation”?\nWhen does confidence become arrogance?\nHow often do we confuse disagreement with disloyalty?\n\n’s research on psychological safety reminds us: when people don’t feel safe to speak up, risk grows silently, sometimes with tragic consequences.\n\nWhat am I holding back?\nHow many people in my team are staying quiet?\nAnd what does that say about the culture we're helping build?\n\nThese are the questions that stay with me long after the credits roll.",
