The company mainly competed withand, selling Class III medical devices with typically high margins. The company’s booming economy continuously boosted its valuation and its workforce.\n\n\nThis rapid growth fueled Boston Scientific’s leadership’s ambitions and transformed its competitive spirit into rivalry. In 2005, the company started a bidding war with its competitor J&J to acquire Guidant, despite early signs of problems with Guidant products. Boston Scientific ultimately won the bidding war and acquired Guidant in 2006 for $27B, marking the largest acquisition in MedTech history at the time.\n\n\nHowever, the celebration was short-lived. Soon after the acquisition, Boston Scientific realized it had bought a ticking bomb. For the next few years, Boston Scientific worked to resolve the Guidant product issues, took substantial write-downs, paid significant amounts to settle various lawsuits, and continuously reported massive operating losses, leading to a steady decline in its market cap as well as its workforce. By 2012, Boston Scientific was only worth $8B.\n\n\nIn the last decade, under the leadership of, Boston Scientific has undergone a significant transformation. The company has shifted its focus to organic growth and market expansion by launching new products. It also changed its M&A strategy to smaller and more tuck-in acquisitions. Additionally, it improved its culture, values, and reputation, ultimately enhancing its financial performance. Today, Boston Scientific has fully restored its economic performance, becoming one of the most valued medical device companies, with a valuation exceeding $150B, while exponentially growing its workforce.\n\n\nPerhaps Boston Scientific's story is one of “Resilience,” or maybe it is a story of “Comeback”. As Rocky famously put it, “It ain’t about how hard you hit, it’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. That is how winning is done.”\n\n\n* Views are my own.

By the 1980s, GE employed over 400,000 people globally, a massive industrial conglomerate with extensive roots in appliances, media, healthcare, aviation, and finance.\n\n\nHowever, GE’s business model underwent significant changes under the leadership of. It was a model that many admired while others feared. During Jack's time, GE became synonymous with cost-cutting, aggressive workforce reduction, and operational efficiency. Jack transformed GE from an industrial company into a massive international conglomerate and the world's most valuable company. His brutal approach to downsizing and offshoring gained him the title “Neutron Jack.” Jack also focused heavily on financialization, growing, its financial services division, into half of GE’s revenue. During Jack’s era, GE reached a valuation of over $500B.\n\n\nBut the same size and complexity that once defined GE’s strength gradually became a liability. In the coming years, GE’s valuation steadily declined as the company failed to seize new growth opportunities or define its purpose. The 2008 financial crisis also exposed GE Capital’s risks, necessitating government assistance and ultimately requiring Warren Buffett to rescue GE. This led to GE's exit from its financial services business in the coming years. By the late 2010s, almost two decades after Jack’s departure, GE’s market cap had fallen to under $100B, a decline of over 80% from its peak.\n\n\nFaced with persistent economic and structural challenges, GE recognized the need for a bold transformation. Under’s leadership, GE decided to break away from its complex conglomerate structure, divesting non-core businesses, and ultimately splitting into three independent public companies, each focused on its respective industry:\n\n1): spun off in January 2023 (CEO),\n2): its energy division, spun off in April 2024 (CEO),\n3): the aviation business, which remains as the new GE (CEO).\n\n\nThe breakup proved to be a remarkable success. Today, the three independent companies have a combined market value of $500B, returning GE to its all-time high. That’s more than a fivefold increase in under three years, making the split one of the most iconic corporate turnarounds in modern history and a masterclass in corporate reinvention.\n\n\n* Views are my own.

      "content": "Philips doesn’t need AI; it needs Focus \n\n\nIn recent years, AI has become a corporate buzzword, with many companies across various industries rushing to integrate it into their products and marketing materials to signal their innovative status and even boost valuation. The wave initially began in the tech sector but soon spread to other industries, including healthcare. By 2024, over 40% of S&P 500 CEOs mentioned AI in their earnings calls.\n\n\nAlthough some of the big tech companies have successfully demonstrated value creation using AI, for many others, the pressure to adopt AI has been mainly driven by FOMO and a desire to improve market perception, rather than a strategic necessity.  This ultimately explains why, a year later, the same executives acknowledged a significant gap between their desired and actual outcomes.\n\n\nRunning AI at scale requires substantial upfront investment, as well as ongoing development and operational costs, with no guaranteed short-term returns. This may not be a concern for companies with access to significant cash. However, for most other companies, especially those facing financial challenges, their resources would be better allocated somewhere else.\n\n\nThis is especially true for Philips. After decades of continuous restructuring, downsizing, and spin-offs, what the company needs now more than anything is focus, not distraction. Chasing AI, however appealing, could distract Philips from its core internal challenges, including operational inefficiencies and a lack of ROI on its R&D activities. To position itself better for sustainable growth in the long term, Philips should focus on two critical priorities.\n\n\nSimplifying Operations\n\nPhilips' operations are very costly, which leaves almost no margin for profit. For comparison, Philips has very similar products to GEHC and nearly identical revenue. Yet Philips has 14,000 more employees. But it is not just the number of employees; Philips also has a very centralized approach to its operation, which significantly increases its managerial overhead. Philips needs to adopt a more decentralized model, internally separating business units, empowering each of its divisions to operate with greater autonomy, and shifting away from global operations. This will enable each division to focus on its customers, operations, and unique value propositions.\n\n\nFocusing R&D\n\nThe same applies to R&D. Philips is one of the top R&D spenders in the industry, yet this high investment has delivered little revenue growth, signaling inefficiencies. Rather than pursuing global or fundamental research, Philips should empower each business unit to focus on product research that directly benefits its customers. Philips has built its reputation through decades of excellence in medical imaging and patient monitoring. Instead of diluting its focus with broad AI initiatives, Philips should double down on its core competencies, co-developing solutions in close partnership with clinicians and scientists.",

Born out of Thomas Edison’s electric light company in the late 1800s,became one of the most iconic and diversified conglomerates of the 20th century, powering homes, lighting cities, building jet engines, and underwriting finance.\n\n\nAt its peak in the early 1980s, GE employed over 400,000 people globally, a massive industrial conglomerate with extensive roots in appliances, media, healthcare, aviation, and finance.

Today, the three divisions have a combined valuation of GE at its peak, making it one of the most iconic comebacks in corporate history.\n\n\nPerhaps GE’s story is one of “reinvention”. It’s a story of breaking apart rather than building up to create value. It is no surprise that GE’s transformation has started a broader shift away from conglomerates in the American industry.\n\n\n*Views are my own.
