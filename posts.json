I aim to make these tests more accessible for widespread use, particularly for visually impaired users, who may be unable to perceive color differences.\n\nI am particularly passionate about creating resourceful, accessible solutions that maximize widespread technology—such as using a smartphone for diagnostics instead of requiring new physical devices. This approach ensures that innovations in disease detection can reach more people without adding unnecessary costs or barriers.\n\nMy work would not have been possible without the guidance of my advisors, Professors Kimberly Hamad-Schifferli and Daniel Haehn, as well as PhD candidate Josselyn Mata, whose insights have been instrumental in shaping my research. It would have also not been possible without UMass Boston's excellent undergraduate research opportunities, including U54 (UMass Boston–Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center partnership), the IDS Fellowship, and BSSF (Beacon Student Success Fellowship), which provide invaluable support for student-led research.\n\nAdditionally, it was an honor to present my research at the\nConference in Pittsburgh, where I had the incredible opportunity to meet and share my work with a broader scientific community and was humbled to receive an award for my presentation.”\n\nIn the photo: Matheus,,, and(left to right), at the Annual Research Symposium at\npresenting early developments of AmpliVision as of Summer 2024.",

Since his arrival at UMB, Daniel has energized the department and made a huge difference to our students through his teaching and event organizing. Congratulations as well!\n\nBeing an award collector, Daniel also just received a Center for Innovative Teaching (CIT) Award for Inclusive Pedagogies at UMass Boston. The CIT's reasoning for this award describes Daniel's achievements very well:\n\n\"Your dedication to fostering inclusivity and diversity within the classroom environment, along with your innovative approaches to decolonizing pedagogies and universal teaching designs, has truly set you apart. Your commitment to creating welcoming and supportive atmospheres for students from all backgrounds, incorporating diverse voices and perspectives into the curriculum, and actively engaging students in the learning process has not gone unnoticed. Your efforts have not only enhanced accessibility and engagement for all students but have also contributed to positive student feedback, learning outcomes, and retention rates. Also, your leadership qualities in advocating for inclusive teaching practices and fostering collaboration among faculty, staff, and students have been commendable.\"\n\nThank you so much!!
