From analysing surgical videos to using AI-powered tools, these insights promise a new level of precision.\n\nü§ù Training & Coaching: Digital tools enable more personalised coaching and development ‚Äî vital in both sports and surgery. Just as coaches guide gymnasts through complex moves, surgeons can review their own techniques in detail, using AI and digital simulations.\n\nüåê Connectivity: While athletes train with coaches in real time, surgeons often operate alone. Today‚Äôs technology bridges this gap, enabling real-time support and collaboration from peers worldwide, and offering insights that can enhance patient care.\n\nFor our healthcare leaders, there‚Äôs a pressing opportunity to adopt these advancements - bringing the same precision that wins trophies into the operating room.\n\nCheck out the full article here:",

Entering the OR on my wheeled bed, I could see an installation mate smiling at me calm and relaxed. Another one (who I couldn't actually see) gently touched my head and then whispered me \"I'm here\".\nI feel these two moments will treasure my heart and memories forever.\nThanks Elisabetta Bajardi,,andfor being my guardian angels while I was on the table.\n\nAfter leaving the OR, I woke up in a different room and then was moved to another. I could have a selfie of the belly region to satisfy my curiosity. I could see a nice plot drawn with a marker, and 4 little patches: that made me smile spontaneously and ask myself: \"..did they fix it?\".\nShortly after, some pain came out and Dr. Gangemi visited me. both of these confirmed me: it was fixed! Pain couldn't prevent me to stand on my feet after less than 6 hours from being awake, look at the threes outside the window and people walking by in Bologna.\nAfter less than 24 hours I was getting my final medication and check from the hospital staff and I was free. Packed up my back-sack and got my baseball cap and I left the hospital heading home. I wanted to get home back to my family.\n\nI'd been looking for a taxi but I couldn't find one so I simply walked to the station.\nSlowly, I walked downtown, had a rewarding ice cream looking at the ancient towers.\nOnce I entered the main railway station I bought train tickets at a digital kiosk. Needed to change 3 trains before getting back. Walking out the station I finally called my loveand she came to pick me up mid way.\n\nI wish to thank everyone atwhere I saw highest professional skills with a remarkably consistent human touch everywhere with every patient.\nI wish to thank Dr.: I liked his mindset and approach at first sight during\ninstallation and loved his inspiring way of sharing his knowledge and vision with everyone. My appreciation of him as the surgeon curing me, although being totally unexpected, was even better and I appreciated his talent in explaining me and answer my curiosity on every detail.\n\nBeing a patient is not a good deal in everyone's life. I wish to express my deepest gratitude to each and every Medtronic employee for the unique way they put patients first, they celebrate patient centricity while protecting patient privacy at the same time.\nFeeling embraced by\nall along this\nturned out as an unforgettable moment of my life and build solid foundation to keep Medtronic's Mission at the core of all I do, always.",

      "content": "Earlier today, Medtronic announced financial results for Q4 and FY23. Our solid results, built on momentum generated in Q3, led to a strong back half and finish to the fiscal year. I‚Äôm encouraged by the progress we‚Äôre seeing ‚Äì growth acceleration, greater supply and market stability, further pandemic recovery, and meaningful portfolio wins.\n\nQ4 revenue growth was broad-based across all our portfolios, with mid-single digit organic growth in Cardiovascular, Neuroscience, and Medical Surgical, and double-digit growth in our Diabetes business in Western Europe. And with recent milestones, like the FDA‚Äôs approval of our MiniMed‚Ñ¢ 780G System and CE Mark for our Affera‚Ñ¢ Mapping and Ablation System, to name just a few, I‚Äôm optimistic about our robust product pipeline across the entire enterprise.\n\nFY23 was full of considerable transformation and change, and I want to thank our employees for their unwavering dedication. Their commitment inspires me, and I‚Äôm deeply grateful for our world-class team. Their efforts continue to advance the Medtronic Mission, ensuring millions of patients can get access to the life-transforming healthcare innovations they need. I couldn‚Äôt be more excited for what‚Äôs to come.",
