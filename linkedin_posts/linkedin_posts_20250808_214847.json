The responses were fascinating‚Äîand telling.\n\nMany chose c.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs completely understandable. As leaders, we‚Äôre often under pressure to have the answers, to deliver results, and to ‚Äòget it right‚Äô. But here‚Äôs the thing:\n‚ö†Ô∏è If failure isn‚Äôt an option, neither is learning. ‚ö†Ô∏è\n\nWhat we explored together in that session was this:\nIf we want growth and better leadership‚Äîwe need an appetite for failure. Not recklessness, but a genuine willingness to experiment, get things wrong, and learn fast. I'm talking aboutand her idea of intelligent failure.\n\nThe leaders who grow the most are the ones who can say:\n\"I didn‚Äôt get that right‚Äîand here‚Äôs what I learned.\"\n\nThey're also the leaders who enable the development of others because they create a safe space where others can also try things out, take measured risks, learn and grow without fear of judgement or retribution.\n\nSo, how do YOU feel about failure? And more importantly‚Äîwhat are you doing to build a culture where it‚Äôs not just tolerated, but seen as essential for progress?\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts üëá type your answer to my question above - a,b,c or d in the comments below.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBeing a manager or a founder shouldn‚Äôt be üí©\n\nI work with managers, leaders, founders and their businesses using coaching and training to ensure that it isn‚Äôt.\n\nI ensure that individuals have the knowledge and awareness to embrace their roles with energy and enjoyment, connect with their confidence and capabilities, and take control of their development and growth, to ensure that they thrive for themselves, their teams, and their businesses.\n\nBecause when we enjoy what we do, we do a great job.

The final line hit me: this wasn‚Äôt just an engineering failure‚Äîit was a culture failure.\n\nStockton Rush, OceanGate‚Äôs founder and CEO, had a bold vision: to democratize deep-sea exploration. But that vision became untouchable. Criticizing the approach became synonymous with criticizing him personally.\n\nFormer chief pilotLochbridge was fired after raising safety concerns, and over time, anyone who challenged the direction either left or was pushed out.\nOceanGate bypassed third-party safety certification from agencies like DNV, arguing it stifled innovation. They used experimental carbon fiber materials against industry norms and ignored repeated warnings about hull fatigue and structural integrity.\n\nThe result? A catastrophic implosion on June 18, 2023, killing all five people onboard, including Rush himself.\n\nThis story echoes whathas long researched around psychological safety‚Äîwhere team members feel safe to speak up, especially about risk. She‚Äôs pointed to NASA‚Äôs Columbia disaster, where engineers suspected damage to the shuttle but stayed silent during final briefings. The culture didn‚Äôt support dissent. The hierarchy silenced truth.\nHere‚Äôs what we can learn as leaders:\n\n- Detach your ego from the mission. You are not your product.\n- Normalize dissent. Especially from the smartest, most principled voices.\n- Invite challenge early and often. Don‚Äôt wait for a wake-up call.\n- Set red lines for safety, ethics, and integrity. They are non-negotiable.\n\nTo do great things, yes, we need vision. But we also need humility. Especially when human lives‚Äîor entire organizations‚Äîare on the line.",
